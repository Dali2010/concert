<h2>Background</h2>

Sitio Bebe is currently facing challenges. The town is experiencing a serious health crisis due to a shortage of water and medical professionals. This is why we have come together to organize a fundraising event that will make a significant impact on the lives of those who call Sitio Bebeb home.

<h2>Purpose of the Event</h2>

Our goal is to raise funds that will be used to investing in research for solutions, supplying medical supplies and medication to the town's medical center, supporting training and scholarships for healthcare professionals, and improving access to clean water through sustainable initiatives. By achieving this, we aim to create a more sustainable and prosperous future for Sitio Bebe.
